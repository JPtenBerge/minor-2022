# Lab 14: JavaScript interop

When adding a new photo, display a map next to the form so users can optionally select where the photo was taken. Use JavaScript interop to determine the selected coordinates.

If there's time, feel free to use a free internet API to retrieve the nearest city for those coordinates.
